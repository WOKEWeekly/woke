Conversation builds a nation.

We never planned on settling for intellectually-bland and meaningless discussions over whose jollof rice is better between Nigerians and Ghanaians, or whether boys find it favourable when girls wear weave. It was this level of distasteful discussion which drove the founding team to revolutionise and change the standard of conversation within the local black community. We sought for more meaningful discussion which would better us as a people.

At #WOKEWeekly, we facilitate debates and discussions centered around and beyond the black community. Through open-floor conversation, we aim to bridge the gap of interaction between opposing sides via debates, as well as seek solutions to existing issues within our society through discussion. Enlightenment is the crux of what we do; it is both the motivation and the goal.

We work primarily with black-centric university societies such as African & Caribbean Societies (ACS) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) societies to deliver sessions which would provide an atmosphere for students to express their views, bounce their ideas and learn from each other.

As of now, been to the following universities:
• Birmingham, University of
• Brunel University London
• King's College London
• Lancaster University
• Manchester, University of / Manchester Metropolitan University / University of Salford

We also work with external organisations, using our expertise of holding the attention of youth in our grip to allow organisations channel their content towards them more easily.
