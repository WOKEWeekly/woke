*About #WOKEWeekly

Conversation builds a nation. It mends the bridge between opponents and creates an understanding which leaves participants enlightened and appeased.

We never planned on settling for intellectually-bland and meaningless discussions over whose jollof rice is better between Nigerians and Ghanaians, or whether boys find it favourable when girls wear weave. It was this level of distasteful discussion which drove the founding team to revolutionise and change the standard of conversation within the local black community. We sought for more meaningful discussion which would better us as a people.

>What exactly do we do?

At #WOKEWeekly, we facilitate debates and discussions centered around and beyond the black community. Through open-floor conversation, we aim to bridge the interaction gap between opposing sides via debates, as well as seek solutions to existing issues within our society through discussion. Enlightenment is the crux of what we do; it is both the motivation and the goal.

The nature of topics discussed at our sessions are diverse, traversing the dimensions of race, gender, <[/mentalhealth] mental health>, society, academia, family, relationships and even in fields such as ethics, history, politics and religion. We take the idle everyday chatter and channel that energy into subjects that  matter.

We work primarily with black-centric university societies such as African & Caribbean Societies (ACS) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) societies to deliver sessions which would provide an atmosphere for students to express their views, bounce their ideas and learn from each other.

As of now, we have held either a single or a series of sessions at the following universities:
• Birmingham, University of
• Brunel University London
• King's College London
• Lancaster University
• Manchester, University of / Manchester Metropolitan University / University of Salford
• Oxford Brookes University
• Royal Holloway, University of London
• Surrey, University of
• York, University of

We also work with external organisations, using our expertise of holding the attention of youth in our grip to allow organisations channel their content towards them more fluidly.

The endgame is the transformation of common conversation; to raise generations of youth you are more in-tune and aware of what really goes on in academia, career journeys, at home, on the streets, in the world and in their minds.
