>What do we do at #WOKEWeekly Mental Health?

This dimension of #WOKEWeekly is an initiative led by our executive and Mental Health Lead, <[/executives/keisha-york] Keisha York>.

By challenging issues from a psychological perspective and breeding an atmosphere for transparent discussion over all things mental health, we aim to break the stigma-flavoured boundaries and encourage the progression of mental self-exploration through conversation.

If we’re not talking about what’s in our minds, we’re talking about what’s outside. Every now and again, we learn something new from Keisha whose extensive knowledge of the field of psychology gives her ability to spread insightful information which enlightens, educates and brings awareness.
