# Contributing to The #WOKEWeekly Website

For starters, thank you for your interest in contributing to the #WOKEWeekly website repository.

When contributing, please discuss with [Zavid](https://github.com/zzavidd) before making any changes.

## Branches, Commits & Pull Requests

As is common practice, please ensure you are making your contributions via feature branches which branch off of the `master` branch.

In addition to the standard:

1. Have your branch names in `kebab-case` format i.e. all lowercase characters separating words with hyphens if need be. For example, `api-design`, `test-fix` and `page-refactor`.

2. Ensure that commits made to your branch are as small as possible. This makes your changes easier to review in the pull request. Endeavour to have each commit correct independently.

3. Rebase your branch onto the `master` branch before submitting a pull request to ensure alignment.

4. All pull requests need to pass the check builds as well as have received an approval from Zavid before merging. Upon approval, please ensure that you **squash & merge** to keep commit history clean.

## Troubleshooting

Remember to pull from `master` before making any changes to the code. It may also be necessary to `npm install` if dependencies have been changed by other contributors.
